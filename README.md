# Q-LearningSnakeGame
Snake is a famous video game originated in the 1976 arcade game Blockade. The player uses up, down, left and right to control the snake which grows in length (when it eats the food pellet), with the snake body and walls around the environment being the primary obstacle. Here, I am training an AI agents using reinforcement learning and Q-learning to play a simple version of the game snake.
